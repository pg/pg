### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently building an AI-enhanced network security and optimization product at [WWT](https://www.wwt.com), and I tinker with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) on hobby embedded systems projects in my spare time. In the past, I have developed web, desktop, and mobile applications using Java. My day-to-day work takes place in private repos, but most of my hobby work gets pushed here.
