### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am currently building an AI-enhanced network security and optimization product at [WWT](https://www.wwt.com), and I tinker with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) on hobby embedded systems projects in my spare time. In the past, I have developed web, desktop, and mobile applications using Java. My day-to-day work takes place in private repos, but most of my hobby work gets pushed here.
- 📫 How to reach me: check my [website](https://petergebhard.com), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/pgeb), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/pgebhard)
