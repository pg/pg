### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am currently building a distributed data analysis engine written in Python, .NET, and C++ for a [WWT](https://www.wwt.com) client, and I tinker with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) on hobby embedded systems projects in my spare time. In the past, I have developed web, desktop, and mobile applications using Java. My client work takes place in private repos, but most of my hobby work gets pushed here.
- 👯 I would love to collaborate on embedded systems projects.
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
- 📫 How to reach me: check my [website](https://petergebhard.com), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/pgeb), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/pgebhard)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have trekked through 6 of the 7 continents. A three-week trek in Nepal up to and around Everest Base Camp was the highlight so far.
